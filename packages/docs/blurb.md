**MedStack**  
A Professional Platform for Clinical Case Discussions and Quick Consultations  

**Overview**  
MedStack is a closed, secure ecosystem built exclusively for verified physicians. It combines the convenience of a chat-style “Quick Consultations” feed for urgent questions with a more in-depth “Clinical Cases” format designed for structured Q&A, detailed files (DICOM, images, videos), and a final “accepted answer.” By bringing both fast feedback and deeper analyses under one roof, MedStack turns every discussion into a searchable medical knowledge base.

**Key Features**  
- **Quick Consultations**: Ask brief, real-time questions in a feed that never buries important posts. Colleagues can respond promptly and attach relevant images or documents.  
- **Clinical Cases**: Present comprehensive case data (exam results, imaging files, treatment history) and crowdsource detailed insights. Once resolved, cases remain accessible for future reference.  
- **Closed, Verified Community**: Only licensed doctors can join, ensuring professional-level discussions. Manual or automated diploma checks guarantee a trusted environment.  
- **Secure Storage & Anonymization**: DICOM files, patient images, and videos are carefully managed to protect patient privacy, preserving confidentiality while allowing rich clinical review.  
- **Reputation & Gamification**: Earn points for providing accepted answers, gain visibility among peers, and build a reputation as a leading contributor in your specialty.

**Why It Matters**  
Physicians often struggle with scattered chats that lose vital information and unstructured forums that make it tough to find definitive solutions. MedStack provides an all-in-one platform: you get the immediacy of a chat for urgent questions plus the depth of a Stack Overflow–style Q&A for thorough case analysis. This streamlines collaboration, supports continuous learning, and nurtures a peer-driven knowledge repository—improving patient care and professional development across specialties.
