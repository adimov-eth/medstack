Medach: a universal platform for quick medical consultations and in-depth discussion of clinical cases

What is it?

We are creating a closed ecosystem for verified doctors, combining “quick consultations” (chat-style format) and “clinical cases” (a structured Q&A format akin to “Stack Overflow”) all in one place. Doctors can promptly ask questions, attach files (DICOM, photos, videos), and receive feedback from colleagues, as well as create full analyses of complex cases with an “accepted answer” option and a record of the entire discussion history.

Main Idea
• “Quick Consultations”: short questions like a Telegram or WhatsApp chat, but none of them get lost in the feed — convenient for quickly getting a colleague’s opinion.
• “Clinical Cases”: detailed descriptions, tags, specialties (cardiology, radiology, etc.), attached studies (photos, videos, DICOM), the ability to vote on answers, and mark a “solution.”

Key Advantages
1. A closed environment exclusively for doctors: each member is verified manually or automatically via diploma checks.
2. Secure data storage: anonymization without any leakage of patients’ personal information.
3. Both a fast format and a deep format: from “urgent” consultation to a full-fledged clinical case.
4. Gamification: ratings, points for solved cases, accepted answers — this keeps motivation high and improves content quality.
5. A structured knowledge base: all cases remain “solved” or “open,” making it easy to search by tags, specialties, and titles.

Why It’s Needed
• Doctors often use chats and social networks, but there questions can get “drowned out,” and it’s difficult to systematize solutions found.
• A “Q&A” system with an “accepted answer” status simplifies searching and guarantees a correct solution can be quickly tracked.
• Secure storage of DICOM, videos, and photos allows full-fledged study of test results.

Who Uses It
• Practicing specialists from various fields (surgeons, therapists, radiologists, cardiologists),
• Residents and young doctors who need rapid support and educational content,
• Niche experts gaining reputation from quality answers, raising their status in the professional community.

Our Plan
1. MVP: implement a quick feed of questions (consultations) and comprehensive “cases” with attachments, reputation, and accepted answers.
2. Mass Onboarding: verify the first 5,000 doctors, run training webinars, and integrate with Telegram communities.

1. General Info
Project Name:
MedStack “A Professional Platform for Clinical Case Discussions and Quick Consultations”
Goal:
Create a system for doctors where they can swiftly post questions (similar to a “chat”) and systematically publish clinical cases (with tags, attachments, statuses), supporting thorough case reviews.

2. Roles & Access
Verified Doctor
• Can use all features: “quick consultations,” full cases, file uploads, viewing others’ discussions.
• Has access to search and filters by specialty, tags.
Administrator/Moderator
• Additionally can remove/hide content, ensuring anonymity rules are followed.
• Manages verification (diploma confirmation).
(No access for non-authorized users — the system is closed.)

3. Core Scenarios
3.1. “Quick Consultations”
The idea is that users can receive a highly prompt answer or “second opinion” without submitting a full case.
Question feed (similar to a feed or chat):
• The user asks a brief question, can attach 1-2 files (photo, video, PDF).
• The post immediately appears in the “quick consultation feed.”
• Doctors respond with short comments (in a compact format).
Minimal structure:
• Tags/Specialty — optional (to let colleagues in the needed specialty filter).
• Sorting: “by date” or “by activity,” so new questions don’t get lost.
Status (optional):
• A question can be marked as “closed,” but remains visible in the archive/history of quick consults.
(The goal is to emulate a Telegram chat but contained within the platform so nothing is lost. Later, a “quick consultation” can be turned into a full “case card” when deeper analysis is required.)

3.2. “Full Clinical Case”
For scenarios requiring detailed breakdowns, more comprehensive information, and careful analysis.
Case Card
Fields: Title, Description (medical history, exam results), Tags (several), Specialty (cardiology, radiology, etc.).
Attachments:
• Files (e.g., DICOM archive)
• Photos (JPEG, PNG)
• Videos (MP4) with an embedded player
Status System
• “Open”: searching for a solution
• “Resolved”: the case author marks an answer as “accepted,” and the case is “closed” for the main discussion but comments remain visible
Case Discussion
• Answers in a Q&A format: possible to “accept an answer” and vote on answers.
• Threaded or flat comments for clarifications.
Gamification (reputation/points)
• Points awarded for creating a case, having an answer accepted, and likes.
• Display points and status in a profile (optional).

4. Tags & Specialty
Choose one (or several) specialties:
• “Specialty” dropdown: cardiology, radiology, neurology, etc.
• Tags can be entered manually or selected from a list (e.g., “MRI,” “ECG,” “COVID,” “Ultrasound”).
• Tags serve as keywords, and “Specialty” is a broader category.
Filters & Search
• Doctors can filter cases/questions by specialty (e.g., only “radiology”), by tags (e.g., “MRI of the hepatobiliary system”).
• Search in titles and case text (full-text or keywords).

5. Attachments (DICOM, Photo, Video)
Files (DICOM archive)
• Uploaded as an archive.
• A simple “download” button allows colleagues to retrieve the file (DICOM processing in the platform is not in the MVP; only downloading).
Photos
• JPEG/PNG, previews displayed immediately.
• Anonymization check (warning not to include personal data in the image).
Videos
• MP4 (recommended) + embedded player (HTML5/Video.js).
• Size limit (e.g., 100–200 MB).
(Storage and playback details — see previous technical specs.)

6. Quick Consultation Feed vs. Full Clinical Cases
To combine both formats:
Quick Question Feed
• Compact form: “Title/question + attached file (optional) + comments (quick answers).”
• Sorted by recency/activity. Suited for “What is this on an X-ray?” or “How to interpret this lab value?”
Moving to a “Case Card”
• If a question is complex and requires deep analysis, the author (or moderator) can “convert” a quick question into a full “case card” with extended fields and Q&A functionality (accepted answer, gamification, etc.).
• Upon conversion, some information automatically transfers to the case (description, attachments).
Interface Sections
• “Quick Consultations”: a continuous feed, good for a prompt reply.
• “Clinical Cases”: a structured repository of solved/unsolved cases, filters, tags, statuses.

7. Gamification (Optional Breakdown)
For “quick consultations”
• Possibly a simplified rating format (like/thank-you), without “accepted answers.”
• Karma is based on the number of active answers and likes received.
For “full cases”
• Classic Q&A model: “accepted answer” brings a higher bonus.
• Case authors also get points (e.g., +5 for publishing, +10 for a resolved case).

8. Technical Requirements (Brief Overview)
Architecture
• Closed system (only authorized doctors).
• REST/GraphQL API, frontend in React/Vue/Angular.
• Cloud storage for DICOM/photos/videos (S3-compatible), size limits.
Performance
• Scaled for up to 5,000 users, with 10–20% possibly online at once.
• Need optimization for large file views and downloads: use CDN and caching.
Security
• HTTPS. Passwords stored in encrypted format.
• Access control to files (presigned URLs or token checks).
• Moderation to remove patient-identifying data.

9. Development Phases
MVP Phase
• Quick consultation feed (short questions + comments).
• Creating “case cards” (title, description, tags, attachments), Q&A with “accepted answer,” basic rating.
• Specialty selection when creating, minimal tagging support.
• Storing/viewing media (photos, videos), DICOM archive (download only).
Iteration 2
• Converting a “quick consultation” to a full case.
• Improved search/filters by tags, specialty.
• Enhanced gamification (points, badges).
• Notifications (internal + email if needed).
Iteration 3
• Scale testing (5,000+ users).
• Optimizing video storage (convert to a single format), CDN for fast loading.
• Polishing UX (user onboarding, platform mini-tour).

10. Acceptance Criteria
Functionality
• Users can post short questions and receive answers (in a “quick consultation” format).
• Users can create a full case (fill tags, select specialty, add DICOM/photo/video attachments).
• Answers/comments work; “accepted answer” in cases sets status to “Resolved.”
Usability
• The interface is clear: “quick question feed” and “clinical case list” are distinctly separated.
• Cases can be filtered by specialty or tags.
• File upload includes a progress bar and an anonymization warning.
Performance
• The system handles simultaneous activity from several hundred users.
• Videos play without critical delay; DICOM files can be downloaded smoothly.
Security
• Only verified doctors can access cases/files.
• A moderator can hide a case/video if personal patient data is found.

How to Use These Descriptions
These text-based wireframes help the design team create layouts in Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD.  
Each screen can be visualized in one or two mockups (Desktop, Mobile).  
It’s important to plan priorities: which screens must be in the MVP and which are second-phase.

Radiologist’s Comment:

About the case interface: I think instead of a separate “answer” field, each case could have a chat thread where we can discuss differential diagnoses, clarify points, etc.

Reply:

1. Overall “Chat Thread” Concept in a Case
Idea: when a doctor opens a case, instead of a traditional “list of answers,” they see a unified chat thread (continuous conversation) where participants can:
• Ask clarifying questions (about differential diagnoses, treatments, anamnesis details)  
• Share diagnostic assumptions or treatment approaches  
• Attach additional files/images directly within messages  
Key differences from a Q&A model:
• There is no single “main answer” but rather a final record: at the end, the author can set an “outcome” or “summary,” but the discussion itself stays in a chat format.  
• It’s intuitive for doctors: similar to a “group Telegram chat” but specifically tied to one case, with no risk of losing context.  
• Flexible structure: participants freely ask each other questions, not just “answers” to the main question.

2. Screens & Elements
2.1. “View Case” Screen (Chat)
• Title, status, and case description at the top  
• Chat message feed  
  – Similar to a messenger: each message shows the doctor’s avatar/name, date/time  
  – Support for attaching files in messages (photos, video, DICOM)  
  – “Quick preview” for images and videos  
• Message input field  
  – “Write a comment…” multi- or single-line  
  – “Paperclip” button to attach files  
  – “Send” button  
• Final summary (optional)  
  – When the case author (or moderator) decides the solution is found, they can post a “summary” (verified diagnosis, key takeaways) and switch the case to “Resolved.”  
  – This summary is shown as a “system message,” e.g., “Case resolved: [verdict text].”  
• Optional side panel/summary  
  – List of attachments in the case  
  – Author info, tags/specialty  
2.2. Case Status: “Open” vs. “Resolved”  
• Open: chat is active, everyone can still post  
• Resolved: formally the case is “closed,” but participants might still add details if allowed  
• Final message is a “Summary/Conclusion,” highlighted visually

3. Advantages of a “Chat” in a Case
• Lively discussion: doctors can exchange brief messages and clarifications, without a rigid “question-answer” structure  
• Flexible format: participants can post follow-up inquiries as new messages; the author replies, and everything remains in one stream  
• Context never gets lost: the entire dialogue is kept together in one thread  
• Easier for differential diagnosis: real-time brainstorming of multiple hypotheses without publishing a “full official answer” each time

4. Marking “Best Ideas” or “Helpful Messages”
To maintain gamification and highlight key insights (akin to “accepted answer”):
• “Likes” or “Recommendations” for individual messages  
  – Each chat message can receive likes (“+1”)  
  – Later, popular messages can be filtered or pinned  
• “Quoting”  
  – If someone posts an important comment, the case author can quote it in the “final summary”: “I confirm Dr. Ivanov’s key point on..., so I endorse that conclusion.”  
• “Summary”  
  – The case author or initiator doctor can post in the end: “Conclusion: …,” mentioning those who contributed most accurately

5. Gamification & Reputation in a Chat Format
• Points for participation  
  – Each message (excluding spam) might grant a base number of points, plus additional points for likes from peers  
• Final “recognition” (verdict)  
  – If, in the final summary, the author states “Dr. Sidorov contributed the critical insight,” Dr. Sidorov might get a special “helped solve N cases” counter  
• Thus, there is no rigid “accepted answer” but still an incentive to provide quality input

6. Technical Details
• Displaying the chat  
  – Messages can be listed from oldest to newest, or vice versa  
  – Possibly limit nested replies to avoid confusion  
• Storing attachments  
  – Photos/videos/DICOM can be attached to any message. Consider a separate gallery with “All case files” for browsing all attachments posted in the chat  
• Search within the conversation  
  – If the thread is extensive, a “Search” field can locate keywords  
• Mobile version  
  – Chat format is typically better on mobile devices, but the UI must handle scrolling, attachments, etc.

7. Conclusion: A Hybrid of “Chat” + “Final Resolution”
Overall:
• Primary content: the case description + media files in the “header”  
• Discussion: a single chat thread for free-flowing input (like a messenger)  
• Closure: a final message from the author or moderator with a “Case Resolved,” optionally naming key contributors  
This approach enables real-time collaborative thinking for differential diagnoses, clarifying questions, while preserving a final solution and referencing attached files/screenshots all in one place.
