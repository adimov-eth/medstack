## Detailed Plan for Integrating Supabase Based on “supabase_guide.md”

Below is a step-by-step outline on how to integrate the Supabase setup and features (from “supabase_guide.md”) into this Next.js/React webapp. This covers environment setup, schema alignment, and recommended spots in the existing frontend code for database interactions.

---

### 1. Configure Supabase in the Webapp

1. **Install Supabase Client Library**  
   - In your “webapp” folder, install the library:  
     › `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
2. **Create a Supabase Client**  
   - Create a new file, for example “supabaseClient.ts”, under “src/lib” or “src/utils”:  
     › Import `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`.  
     › Use environment variables for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.  
   - This client will be your main interface for queries (cases, answers, attachments, etc.).

---
    
### 2. Align the Database Schema

Refer to the tables outlined in “supabase_guide.md” (e.g., “cases”, “answers”, “attachments”, “profiles”). You will do these steps in the Supabase dashboard or using the Supabase CLI migrations:

1. **Create / Verify Tables**  
   - Ensure you have `cases`, `answers`, `attachments`, and a `profiles` table for user metadata.  
   - Inspect your RLS policies to allow only authenticated users to insert/view.  
   - Add indexes / foreign-key constraints as described.

2. **Configure Row Level Security**  
   - In Supabase, enable RLS on each table. Then add policies to control who can “SELECT”, “INSERT”, “UPDATE”, or “DELETE” from each table.  
   - For example, let the `cases.author_id` or an “admin” update the record.

---
    
### 3. Manage Authentication Flows

In the existing “auth-pages.tsx” file, you have placeholders for login/sign-up. Incorporate Supabase Auth:

1. **Sign Up**  
   - Use `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password, ... })`.  
   - After success, insert a corresponding row into “profiles”.
2. **Log In**  
   - Use `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })` (the newer method).  
   - Store or observe the session to confirm the user is logged in.  
3. **Profile Table Sync**  
   - On registration, you’ll also want to store user’s specialty, institution, etc. in the “profiles” table.  

---
    
### 4. Adding “Create Case” (cases/new/page.tsx)

Your “create-case.tsx” component is set to gather a title, specialty, description, and file attachments. Here’s how to hook it to Supabase:

1. **Upload Attachments**  
   - After the user selects files, call `supabase.storage.from('clinical-attachments').upload(...)`.  
   - Collect returned file paths/URLs.  
2. **Insert Case**  
   - Call `.from('cases').insert([{ title, description, specialty, author_id }])`.  
   - For each uploaded file, insert a row into “attachments” with `parent_case_id = newlyCreatedCase.id`.
3. **Confirm Privacy**  
   - Retain the logic you already have for the user to confirm patient info is removed.

---
    
### 5. Displaying Cases (cases/page.tsx)

In your “cases-list.tsx”:

1. **Fetch from Supabase**  
   - Replace the mock data with:  
     › `let { data: cases, error } = await supabase.from('cases').select('*').order('created_at', { ascending: false })`  
   - Possibly filter by `.eq('specialty', specialty)` if the user selected a specialty.
2. **Search**  
   - Implement a `.ilike('title', '%' + searchTerm + '%')` or `.textSearch(...)` if you want full-text search.

---
    
### 6. Case Detail & Answers (cases/[id]/page.tsx)

Your “case-detail.tsx” shows a single case plus answers. Integrate Supabase queries:

1. **Fetch Case & Answers**  
   - `supabase.from('cases').select('*, answers(*), attachments(*)').eq('id', caseId)`.  
2. **Display Attachments**  
   - If they’re private, create signed URLs (`.createSignedUrl(...)`) to show images or PDF links.  
3. **Add Answer**  
   - Insert into “answers” table. Then fetch again or push the new answer into state.  
   - For answer attachments (if you allow them), upload to the same bucket but reference `parent_answer_id`.

---
    
### 7. Authentication Checks

1. **Protecting Routes**  
   - In Next.js, you might have a server-side check or client-side logic (e.g., “if no session, redirect to /login”).  
2. **Edge Cases**  
   - If user is not logged in, hide “Create Case” or “Submit Answer” buttons.  
   - If user is the case author, allow “Accept Answer” logic.

---
    
### 8. Adding Realtime (Optional)

If you want to see new answers appear in real time:

1. **Realtime Setup**  
   - Enable Realtime on “cases” or “answers” in the Supabase dashboard.  
   - Subscribe to changes in your React code using `supabase.channel('any').on('*', ...).subscribe()`.

---
    
### 9. Deploy & Production

1. **Environment Variables**  
   - In your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
2. **Check RLS & Policies**  
   - Confirm you’re not blocking legitimate requests or allowing unauthorized updates.
3. **Performance**  
   - If you expect heavy usage, consider caching frequently accessed data or using a higher-tier Supabase plan.

### Final Remarks

This plan closely follows the structure in “supabase_guide.md” and maps each step to your existing Next.js / React codebase. You’ll be able to handle user registration, case creation, file uploads, and Q&A interactions, all powered by Supabase’s Auth, Database, and Storage services. Once integrated, you can enhance further with gamification, search, advanced RLS logic, or notifications. Good luck!
