Below is a **step-by-step plan** for implementing an MVP of a “Medical Stack Overflow”–style platform using **Supabase**. The focus here is strictly on the **Clinical Case Q&A** component (no quick chat consultations). Each case is a “topic” where doctors can post detailed information, attach files, and receive answers. Cases are categorized/sorted by specialties or tags.

---

# 1. Project Setup & Requirements

## 1.1. Initialize a Supabase Project

1. **Create a Supabase Account**  
   - Go to [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/), create an account or log in.
   - Create a new project. Supabase will provision a PostgreSQL database, authentication services, storage, and more.

2. **Obtain Project Credentials**  
   - Once the project is created, note your `PROJECT_URL` and `PROJECT_ANON_KEY` (or `SERVICE_KEY`) for local development.

3. **Local Environment**  
   - Optionally, install the Supabase CLI to manage migrations and test locally (if desired).  
   - Or you can use the **online SQL editor** in the Supabase dashboard to set up your schema.

## 1.2. Tech Stack for the MVP

- **Frontend**: Choose a framework (e.g., **React** or **Next.js**).  
- **Backend**:  
  - Typically, you won’t need a separate backend server if you rely heavily on Supabase’s Auth, Database, and Storage.  
  - For custom logic (e.g., awarding points, moderation tasks), you can use **Supabase Edge Functions** or a small Node.js server.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (auto-provisioned by Supabase).  
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage buckets for attachments (images, PDFs, DICOM archives, etc.).  
- **Auth & Security**: Supabase’s Auth service, plus **Row-Level Security** (RLS) policies for access control.

---

# 2. Database Schema Design

We’ll define four main entities:

1. **Users**  
2. **Cases** (the main “topics”)  
3. **Answers** (submissions to a case)  
4. **Attachments** (linked to either a case or an answer)  

You also need some way to **categorize** or **tag** each case (e.g., by specialty).

## 2.1. Users

Supabase automatically creates a `users` table in their Auth schema, but you can create a separate `public.profiles` table to store user-specific metadata (like name, specialty, etc.).

### Example: `profiles` table (public schema)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS profiles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  full_name text,
  specialty text,        -- e.g., "Radiology", "Cardiology", etc.
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS for profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 2.2. Cases

Each “case” or “topic” is a row in the `cases` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cases (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users (id),
  title text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  specialty text,      -- or you can store multiple tags in an array
  status text DEFAULT 'open',  -- 'open' or 'resolved'
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS for cases
ALTER TABLE cases ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 2.3. Answers

Users can post multiple answers to a single case. An answer can be “accepted” if it’s recognized as a solution.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS answers (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  case_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES cases (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users (id),
  content text NOT NULL,
  is_accepted boolean DEFAULT false,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE answers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 2.4. Attachments

We can store file metadata in a separate table. This table references either a **case** or an **answer** (some Q&A platforms only allow attachments to the main question; you may allow them on answers too).

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS attachments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  parent_case_id uuid REFERENCES cases (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_answer_id uuid REFERENCES answers (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_url text NOT NULL,       -- pointer to the Supabase Storage file
  file_type text,               -- e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'application/pdf'
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE attachments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

> Note: For categorizing multiple specialties or tags, consider an additional `case_tags` table, or store an array of tags in `cases.tag_list text[]`.

# 3. Authentication & Authorization

## 3.1. Supabase Auth Flow

1. **User signs up** (email/password).  
2. **User receives a confirmation link** (optional double opt-in).  
3. **User appears in `auth.users`** table.  
4. **Insert a row** in `profiles` table with the same user `id`.  

## 3.2. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### 3.2.1. Profiles RLS

Allow users to read/write their own profile:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow individuals to view their own profiles"
ON profiles
FOR SELECT USING ( auth.uid() = id );

CREATE POLICY "Allow individuals to modify their own profiles"
ON profiles
FOR UPDATE WITH CHECK ( auth.uid() = id );
```

*(Adjust or broaden if you want all users to see each other’s public profile.)*

### 3.2.2. Cases RLS

- **Select**: Let all **logged-in users** view all cases.  
- **Insert**: Let any **verified** user create a case (if you have a `verified` field on the user’s profile).  
- **Update**: Only the **author** should be able to edit, or an **admin**.  
- **Delete**: Possibly only an admin or a moderator can remove a case.

```sql
-- Turn on RLS
ALTER TABLE cases ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Everyone can read cases"
ON cases
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Case author can update their own case"
ON cases
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = author_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Case author can insert a new case"
ON cases
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

### 3.2.3. Answers RLS

- **Select**: All authenticated users can read.  
- **Insert**: Any authenticated user can answer.  
- **Update**: Only the author can update (or an admin).  
- **Accepting an Answer**: If you want only the case author to mark `is_accepted = true`, enforce that via a separate logic layer (Edge Function) or a policy that checks the relationship to the parent case.

```sql
ALTER TABLE answers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Answers can be read by all authenticated users"
ON answers
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create answers"
ON answers
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);

CREATE POLICY "Answer author can update their own answer"
ON answers
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = author_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id);
```

*(For marking an answer as accepted, you might need additional logic: only the case’s original author can set `is_accepted=true`—this can be done via an Edge Function or a more advanced policy that checks the `cases.author_id` relationship.)*

### 3.2.4. Attachments RLS

- **Select**: All authenticated users can view attachments if they can view the parent case or answer.  
- **Insert**: The user must be the **author** of the case/answer.  
- **Delete**: Possibly only the attachment’s owner or an admin.

You might store the user relationship explicitly if needed. Otherwise, handle it with serverless functions or custom checks.

# 4. File Storage & Attachments

## 4.1. Setting Up a Storage Bucket

1. In the **Supabase Dashboard**, go to **Storage** → **Create new bucket**.  
   - Name it something like `clinical-attachments`.  
   - Set the bucket’s access to “Private” so that only authenticated calls can access files.

2. **Security Policies**  
   - Use Supabase’s [signed URLs or object-level security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage#policies) to ensure only the correct user (or all doctors) can see those attachments.

## 4.2. Uploading Files

- In your frontend, when creating a new case or answer, you let the user upload images/pdfs:  
  - Call `supabase.storage.from('clinical-attachments').upload('some/path/file.png', fileBlob)`  
  - Store the returned URL/path in the `attachments.file_url` column.  

## 4.3. Downloading/Viewing Files

- For private files, you’ll typically generate a signed URL:
  ```js
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .storage
    .from('clinical-attachments')
    .createSignedUrl('some/path/file.png', 60 /* expiration in seconds */);
  ```
- Use that signed URL in an `<img src="..."/>` or a link to download.

# 5. Core Application Flows

## 5.1. Creating a New Case

1. **User logs in** (Supabase Auth).  
2. **User fills out “Create Case” form**: title, description, specialty, plus optional file attachments.  
3. **Upload attachments** to Supabase Storage, get back file URLs.  
4. **Insert** a row into `cases` with (title, description, specialty, user’s `id`) via Supabase client.  
5. **Insert** rows into `attachments` referencing `parent_case_id = the new case.id`.

## 5.2. Viewing a List of Cases

1. **Frontend** calls `.from('cases').select('*')` (or selects specific fields).  
2. **Order** by `created_at DESC` or another criterion (popularity, specialty).  
3. **Display** summary cards (title, specialty, status) in a list.

## 5.3. Viewing a Single Case & Answers

1. **Fetch** case data: `select('*, attachments(*), answers(*)')` (or use multiple queries).  
2. **Display** case info, attachments, a list of answers.  
3. **Answers** are fetched from the `answers` table (where `case_id = selectedCase.id`).  
4. **Attachments** from the `attachments` table (where `parent_case_id = selectedCase.id`).

## 5.4. Posting an Answer

1. **User** enters answer text.  
2. **Insert** a row in `answers`, referencing the `case_id`.  
3. **Optional**: If attachments are allowed, similarly upload files to storage and store references in `attachments` with `parent_answer_id`.

## 5.5. Marking an Answer as Accepted

1. By default, only the case author can do this.  
2. **Frontend** updates the answer row: `is_accepted = true`.  
3. A policy or Edge Function can restrict this action to ensure only `cases.author_id` can set it.

---

# 6. Sorting & Categorization

## 6.1. Specialty-Based Sorting

- Each case has a `specialty` column (e.g., `'Cardiology'`, `'Radiology'`).  
- On your “Case List” page, provide a dropdown or tabs for specialty.  
- **Query** example:
  ```js
  // Filter by specialty
  let { data: cases, error } = await supabase
    .from('cases')
    .select('*')
    .eq('specialty', 'Radiology')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  ```

## 6.2. Multi-Tagging

If you need more flexible tagging (multiple tags per case):

1. **Add a `tags text[]` column** to `cases`.  
2. Use `.cs('tags', ['MRI', 'Hip'])` to filter by tags containing `'MRI'` and `'Hip'`.  
3. Alternatively, create a **many-to-many** relationship with a separate `tags` table and a join table.

---

# 7. Frontend Implementation Outline

Assuming React + Supabase client library:

1. **Install Supabase**  
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   ```

2. **Initialize**  
   ```js
   // supabaseClient.js
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

   const supabaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
   const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

   export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
   ```

3. **Auth**  
   - Create a login/signup page.  
   - Use `supabase.auth.signIn({ email, password })` or `signUp({ email, password })`.

4. **Cases List Page**  
   - On mount, fetch cases with `supabase.from('cases').select('*')`.  
   - Render a table/list with title, specialty, creation date, etc.  
   - Provide a filter control for specialty (e.g., dropdown).

5. **Case Detail Page**  
   - Fetch the case by `id` from the URL.  
   - Display case info, attachments, and answers.  
   - For attachments, generate signed URLs to preview images or provide download links.

6. **Create Case Page**  
   - A form with fields: `title`, `description`, `specialty`.  
   - Optional file upload: 
     1. Upload each file to storage (`supabase.storage`).  
     2. Keep track of the returned path(s).  
     3. Insert the case, then insert attachments referencing that case ID.

7. **Answer Form**  
   - A textarea or rich text editor for the answer content.  
   - Insert into `answers` when submitted.  
   - Optional attachments for answers.

8. **Accept Answer**  
   - Show an “Accept” button only if `auth.uid() === case.author_id`.  
   - On click, update the answer row (`is_accepted = true`).

---

# 8. Testing & QA

## 8.1. Local Testing

- Use **Supabase CLI** or the **Supabase test environment** to run your local instance if you prefer. Otherwise, you can test directly against the hosted instance for an MVP.

## 8.2. RLS Debugging

- Make sure your RLS policies allow the intended reads/inserts.  
- Use the Supabase dashboard’s “Policies” tab or run SQL queries directly to verify.

## 8.3. Data Validation

- Basic checks: ensure titles aren’t empty, description length is reasonable, etc.  
- Possibly use a custom Edge Function or client-side checks to limit file types or sizes.

---

# 9. Iteration & Future Features

1. **Search**: Implement full-text search on `cases` (title, description) using Postgres’ built-in search.  
2. **Reputation/Gamification**:  
   - Add columns to `profiles` for points, track each accepted answer.  
   - Increment user points when their answer is accepted or upvoted.  
3. **Notifications**: Use Supabase **Realtime** or **Edge Functions** to trigger emails or push notifications when new answers arrive.  
4. **Moderation Tools**: Admin panel to remove/edit cases or answers that violate guidelines.  
5. **File Anonymization**: For advanced healthcare compliance, consider partial metadata stripping, disclaimers, or a DICOM anonymization tool if large imaging is core to your app.

---

## 10. Production Considerations

1. **Performance & Concurrency**  
   - For thousands of concurrent doctors, watch your database usage. You may need a higher Supabase plan or Postgres scaling.  
2. **HIPAA Compliance**  
   - If handling actual PHI in the U.S., consider hosting Supabase yourself with encryption, or verify Supabase’s compliance.  
3. **Custom Domain & HTTPS**  
   - Point your custom domain to the frontend hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and ensure secure, encrypted connections.  
4. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**  
   - Supabase automatically handles daily backups on higher tiers. For critical data, schedule extra backups.

---

# 11. Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Create Supabase Project**: set up environment, gather keys.  
2. **Design Schema**: create `cases`, `answers`, `attachments`, `profiles` tables in your database.  
3. **Define RLS Policies**: ensure correct read/write rules.  
4. **Configure Storage**: set up a private bucket for case attachments.  
5. **Frontend Pages**: 
   - **Login/Signup**  
   - **Cases List** (with filtering by specialty)  
   - **Case Detail** (view answers, post new answers, see attachments)  
   - **Create Case** (upload attachments, insert case)  
6. **Test & Validate**: confirm RLS, attachment uploads, answer acceptance.  
7. **Iterate**: add search, tags, moderation, user profiles, etc.
